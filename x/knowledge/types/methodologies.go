// Methodology ID constants. Stable identifiers referenced on-chain by every

//
// The bootstrap methodologies are grounded in recognized epistemic traditions:
//
//   M-FORMAL          — foundationalism (Frege, Russell, Hilbert): truth-
//                       preserving inference from stated premises in a named
//                       formal system.
//   M-EMPIRICAL       — logical empiricism + Popper: hypothesis, prediction,
//                       test, replication. Corroboration as failed falsification.
//   M-COMPUTATIONAL   — algorithmic verification: Turing-decidable claims.
//   M-TESTIMONIAL     — social epistemology (Goldman, Fricker): trust in
//                       independent primary sources with lineage.
//   M-ANALOGICAL      — structural mapping (Hofstadter, Gentner): invariant-
//                       preserving analogies with counterexample testing.
//   M-DIALECTICAL     — Habermasian discourse + Popper: survival under
//                       adversarial challenge over time.
//   M-PRAGMATIC       — pragmatism (Peirce, Dewey, James): truth as what
//                       generates reliable practical consequences.
//   M-COHERENTIST     — coherentism (BonJour, Lehrer): truth by fit in a web
//                       of mutually-supporting beliefs.
//   M-PHENOMENOLOGICAL — phenomenology (Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Varela):
//                       first-person structured description of experience.
//   M-HISTORICAL      — historical method (Ranke, Collingwood): truth by
//                       documented primary-source record with provenance.
//   M-ECOLOGICAL      — situated knowing (Haraway, Longino, TEK): relational
//                       truth explicit about its context.
//   M-PRACTICE        — tacit / consensus-of-practitioners (Polanyi,
//                       Wittgenstein, Kuhn's "normal science"): valid in a
//                       domain if engaged practitioners agree.
