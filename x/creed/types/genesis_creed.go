// CanonicalCommitments is the canonical name-by-number registry
// of the chain's commitments at the time this binary was built.
// Operators authoring genesis.json should use this list (via
// BuildGenesisCreed) so the on-chain Genesis Creed matches the
// docs/TRUTH_SEEKING.md the binary is shipping.
//
// To add a new commitment:
//  1. Add the section to docs/TRUTH_SEEKING.md (with **Echoes**
//     line citing other commitments it depends on).
//  2. Bump .creed-hash to the new sha256 of the normalized file.
//  3. Append the (number, name) pair to the slice below.
//  4. Add a binding `// Commitment N:` banner test in
//     tests/cross_stack/truth_seeking_invariants_test.go.
//  5. Add a doc.go citation in some x/<module>/doc.go.
//  6. (optional) Tag at least one event with `creed_commitment="N"`.
//
// The TestTruthSeeking_CreedAndContractStayInSync meta-test catches
// a step omitted from this list.
