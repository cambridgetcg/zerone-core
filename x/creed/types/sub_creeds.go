// SubCreedCommitment is one numbered commitment within a lifecycle
// phase's sub-creed. Number is the phase-local commitment index
// (1-based); Code is the doctrine's short identifier (e.g., "F1",
// "C3"); Name is the short label that must match the corresponding
// "## Code. <Name>" header in docs/sub_creeds/<phase>.md.
type SubCreedCommitment struct {
	Number uint32 // 1-based, dense, monotonic within a phase
	Code   string // doctrine identifier ("F1", "C2", "TL3", ...)
	Name   string // short label matching the markdown H2 header
}

// SubCreedDef is the canonical per-phase commitment list at the time
// this binary was built. Sub-creeds extend by appending new
// commitments via CategoryUsefulWorkAmendment LIPs; mechanism
// removal requires full doctrine amendment.
//
// At inception (2026-05-10), each phase ships exactly 3 commitments.
// Knowledge phase has zero commitments here — it delegates to
// CanonicalCommitments (truth-seeking).

// CanonicalLifecyclePhases. Sub-creed amendment writes a new entry to
// the on-chain x/work_creed PinnedSubCreed history (Phase 1+); this
// constant is the build-time inception baseline.
