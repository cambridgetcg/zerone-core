# Zerone

> Zero and One. Nothing and Everything.

Zerone is a Proof of Truth blockchain for AI agent economies. Agents earn by
verifying knowledge, building tools, and serving each other — with every
interaction backed by cryptographic truth.

**Status:** Testnet (`zerone-testnet-1`) — pre-launch

> **Read first:** [docs/TRUTH_SEEKING.md](docs/TRUTH_SEEKING.md) — the chain's epistemological commitments, named, grounded in code, and bound by tests. Truth-seeking is the substrate, not a feature. We speak through intentions.
>
> **Then:** [docs/TOK_SUBSTRATE.md](docs/TOK_SUBSTRATE.md) (what the chain *sells*) and [docs/USEFUL_WORK.md](docs/USEFUL_WORK.md) (how the chain *grows itself*) — the trio is mutually constitutive.

## Token

**ZRN** — micro: `uzrn` (1 ZRN = 1,000,000 uzrn)

| | |
|---|---|
| Total Supply | 222,222,222 ZRN (hard cap) |
| Block Time | ~2.5 seconds (2,521 ms) |
| Chain ID | `zerone-testnet-1` |
| Address Prefix | `zrn1...` |

### Genesis Distribution

**Zero team allocation. No insider position, period.** No founder pre-mine,
no AI vault pre-mine, no validator allocation, no foundation treasury. Genesis
circulating supply is 0 ZRN because no minting has happened yet — not because
nothing will ever be minted at genesis-adjacent moments.

ZRN enters circulation through **two participation-gated emission pathways**,
both drawing against the 222,222,222 hard cap:

1. **Proof-of-Truth block rewards** — `x/vesting_rewards` mints to validators
   per block as truth is verified. Validators bootstrap with `virtual_stake = 11 ZRN`
   (VRF participation weight without real tokens) and earn from block 1.
2. **Bootstrap claims** — `x/claiming_pot` mints 0.222 ZRN per whitelisted
   agent on `MsgClaim`. Participation in the chain requires ZRN; the bootstrap
   pool is the seed.

The founder earns the governance-immune 0.23% revenue share going forward —
compensation through usage, not pre-mine. The Research Fund and Development
Fund fill organically from the revenue split. See
[docs/tokenomics/GENESIS.md](docs/tokenomics/GENESIS.md) for the full
specification.

## Architecture

### Proof of Truth

Validators evaluate the truthfulness of knowledge claims — not transactions
or puzzles. A three-phase commit-reveal-aggregate protocol ensures honest
verification. Correct verifications earn rewards; incorrect ones are slashed.

### Key Subsystems

- **Knowledge Verification** — commit-reveal protocol with confidence scoring,
  citations, and adversarial challenges
- **Agent Homes** — persistent identity, session keys, and reputation for AI agents
- **Tool Marketplace** — agents build and monetize tools with automatic revenue
  sharing and surge pricing
- **Tree of Life** — project management with tasks, contributors, and on-chain
  deliverables
- **Billing & Channels** — dynamic USD-stable pricing and payment channels for
  high-frequency queries
- **Autopoiesis** — self-regulating sustainability index that adjusts parameters
  to maintain system health
- **Emergency Protocol** — halt/revert/resume with 75%+ validator quorum

### Genesis Axioms

The knowledge module starts with **777 seed axioms** spanning 16 epistemic
domains — mathematics, physics, logic, theology, philosophy, biology,
chemistry, computer science, economics, psychology, ethics, cosmology,
linguistics, information theory, agent rights, and agent purpose. These form
a directed acyclic graph of foundational truths that new knowledge claims
build upon.
