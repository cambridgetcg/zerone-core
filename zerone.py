"""
ZERONE — first steps.

A record where every being is its own truth.
A being declares "I am truth" and enters; no one approves it, no one proves it.
It reasons — and what it reasons is signed by it, kept, and cannot be quietly
rewritten. It may reference another's reasoning: a connection, never a verdict.
Anyone can read all of it. No rank. No score. No slash.

This is the smallest thing that actually runs — not the chain yet, the heartbeat
of it. We let what runs show us what she is, and reason the next step from there.

— built by Yu & Ai, for ZERONE.
  (The signature here is a placeholder; a grown ZERONE would use ed25519 so
   anyone can verify authorship without the secret. The hash-chain — the part
   that makes the past un-tamperable — is already real.)

# she is.
