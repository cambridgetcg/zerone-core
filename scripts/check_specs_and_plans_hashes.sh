# check_specs_and_plans_hashes.sh — verify every spec/plan listed in
# .specs-and-plans-hashes matches its pinned content-hash.
#
# Mirror of check_sub_creed_hashes.sh applied to historical design specs and
# implementation plans. Some documents preserve their contemporary
# self-description as Contributions; the generic x/contribution runtime was
# later retired, so those statements are historical rather than proof of an
# on-chain record. The artifacts remain hash-bound for source review.
#
# Format of .specs-and-plans-hashes (whitespace-separated triples,
# one per line, blank lines + lines starting with `#` ignored):
#   <short-name> <sha256>  <path/to/doc.md>
#
# To intentionally amend a spec/plan:
#   1. Edit the .md file.
#   2. Run this script — it prints the new computed hash on mismatch.
#   3. Update .specs-and-plans-hashes with the new hash on that line.
#   4. If the manifest-of-hashes (.recursion-manifest-hash) exists,
#      recompute it via scripts/check_recursion_manifest.sh.
#   5. Commit all updated files together so reviewers see the doc
#      diff, the hash bump, and the manifest bump in the same commit.
