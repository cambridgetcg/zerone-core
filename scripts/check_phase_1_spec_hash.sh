# check_phase_1_spec_hash.sh — verify the Phase 1 useful-work
# orchestrator design spec has not drifted from .phase-1-spec-hash.
#
# Mirror of check_creed_hash.sh applied to a historical specification
# document. Hash-anchoring the Phase 1 spec extends the same off-chain
# enforcement the doctrines receive to a design artifact that shaped the
# source. It does not create an on-chain Contribution record.
#
# UW: ZERONE is recursive — the chain's design is among the work the
# chain pays for, and the spec is hash-bound the same way the doctrines
# are. The recursion is structural, not metaphorical.
#
# To intentionally amend the spec:
#   1. Edit docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-10-useful-work-phase-1-orchestrator-design.md.
#   2. Run this script — it will print the new computed hash.
#   3. Update .phase-1-spec-hash with the new value.
#   4. Commit both files together so reviewers see both the spec text
#      change AND the hash bump in the same commit.

Phase 1 spec hash check failed.

Expected (from $HASH_FILE): $EXPECTED
Actual (computed):          $ACTUAL

If you intentionally changed the spec, update $HASH_FILE to:
  $ACTUAL

The spec is protected by repository-local hash review; this does not imply an
on-chain Contribution record. The hash bump is the visible signal that the
chain's design record has shifted, prompting full diff review.
