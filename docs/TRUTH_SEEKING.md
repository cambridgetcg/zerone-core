# Truth-Seeking — the chain's epistemological commitments

> Truth is not a feature of this chain. It is the substrate.

Every architectural decision in this codebase either expresses our commitment to truth-seeking or contradicts it. Where mechanisms have felt mechanical, where naming has felt arbitrary, where parameters have felt chosen for plausibility — those have been latent debts. This document gathers the commitments, names them as commitments, grounds each in code, and names what would break each.

**We speak through intentions.** Every line of code, every comment, every parameter, every event name is a declaration of what we believe. A decision that contradicts a commitment is not a feature trade-off. It is a failure of the chain to be what we said it would be.

The bindings below are not aspirations. They are tested. The test suite at `tests/cross_stack/truth_seeking_invariants_test.go` is the executable form of this document — each test names a commitment, drives the chain through a scenario where the commitment could be violated, and asserts the violation cannot occur. If a commitment breaks, the test breaks. The creed and the contract are one.

## The commitments

### 1. Methodology over statement

We believe: a claim's value comes from *how* it can be tested, not from *what* it asserts. The chain values methodology — the declared path of derivation and falsifiability — over the surface content of the claim. A claim without a methodology is not a fact; a methodology that yields no testable claim is not knowledge.

**Code expression**: `Fact.MethodId` is mandatory; the TVW formula multiplies a methodology-normalisation factor; reasoning traces are first-class fields. See `x/knowledge/keeper/training_economics.go:ComputeTrainingValueWeight` and `x/knowledge/keeper/rounds.go:createFactFromClaim`.

**What would break it**: facts entering `FACT_STATUS_VERIFIED` with empty `MethodId`, or TVW computation that ignored methodology, or training pipelines that consumed claims without their reasoning trace.

**Echoes**: commitment 14 (reasoning traces are first-class — methodology without trace is just labelling); commitment 3 (Popper, not popularity — methodology is what makes a claim *testable*).

---

### 2. Is-ought wall

We believe: descriptive facts and normative commitments are categorically different and must not be substituted for each other. A model trained on facts that are actually values has been silently corrupted; a value system grounded in claimed facts that are actually opinions has lost the ability to dissent. The wall must be structural, not advisory.

**Code expression**: `NormativeCommitment` is a separate proto type, stored under a distinct key prefix (`0x59`), with no `confidence` field. `FilterIsOughtIds` blocks commitment IDs from `ContributionRecord.fact_ids`. `ComputeTrainingValueWeight` returns `BlockedByIsOught=true` for any ID resolving to a commitment.

**What would break it**: a `NormativeCommitment` ID that successfully accrued TVW, or a Fact accepted with content that is structurally a value-claim, or any path that conflates the two registries.

**Echoes**: commitment 13 (training corpus is not for sale — the wall is what keeps the corpus *categorically* clean, not just curated); commitment 1 (methodology over statement — the methodology of an ought-claim is normatively distinct from the methodology of an is-claim).

---

### 3. Popper, not popularity

We believe: truth is what survives falsification, not what is most asserted. A claim that has withstood ten serious attempts to refute it is more credible than one that has been verified ten times. The chain rewards survival, not consensus volume.

**Code expression**: `BaseWeight = CorroborationCount + 1` where `CorroborationCount` increments on *rejected challenges*, not on initial verifications. The `HardeningMultiplier` accelerates with survived attacks (Wave 14d). `Fact.Confidence` is gated by survival, not voting margin.

**What would break it**: TVW formulas that read raw acceptance count over corroboration count; reward paths that pay for being verified rather than for surviving challenge; hardening that flattens (linear-only) instead of compounding.

**Echoes**: commitment 4 (substrate stress-tests its truth — Popper is the principle, stress-testing is the operationalisation); commitment 13 (training corpus not for sale — survived disproof is the only currency that buys a place).

---

### 4. The substrate stress-tests its own truth

We believe: the chain does not protect its trusted claims — it invites their falsification. A 90%-confidence fact must be CHEAPER to probe than a 10%-confidence fact, because the higher the confidence, the more we owe the substrate the discipline of testing it.

**Code expression**: `EffectiveMinChallengeStake` scales *inversely* with target confidence (`x/knowledge/keeper/confidence.go`). `SuccessfulChallengeRewardBps` amplifies with the disproven fact's confidence — paradigm shifts pay more than routine cleanup. Failed probes earn a 15% participation refund. The probe bounty pool mints uzrn per block to fund probing of the chain's most-trusted claims.

**What would break it**: stake scaling that punishes probing of confident claims; reward schedules where disproving a 10% fact pays the same as disproving a 90% fact; failed probes that confiscate full stake.

**Echoes**: commitment 3 (Popper — this commitment puts a price on the falsification opportunity); commitment 5 (chain manufactures probe demand — stress-testing requires both invitation and reward); commitment 12 (chain pays for own audit — without dedicated funding, stress-testing is rhetoric).

---

### 5. The chain manufactures probe demand

We believe: waiting for probers to arrive is not enough. The substrate names its own under-tested high-confidence facts and pays for them to be tested. Truth-seeking that depends on volunteers shows up only when convenient is rhetoric, not commitment.

**Code expression**: `InviteIdleFactsForProbing` runs each block, scans for high-confidence facts that have gone idle, emits `probe_invited` events, and stamps `Fact.ProbeInvitedAtBlock`. The probe bounty pool mints uzrn per block, capped at a maximum, paying flat invitation bonuses to whoever answers.

**What would break it**: heartbeat that only fires when triggered externally; bounty pool that depends on user funding rather than chain mint; invitations that pay nothing, making them rhetoric.

**Echoes**: commitment 4 (substrate stress-tests its truth — invitation is the substrate's voice doing the asking); commitment 12 (chain pays for own audit — the bounty pool that funds invitation bonuses is the same pool that funds successful-probe rewards).

---

### 6. No individual can unilaterally inject truth

We believe: a single key — even the legitimate authority key — must not be able to silently inject content into the training corpus. Cryptographic provenance is meaningless if one signature can override it. Plurality is structural.

**Code expression**: `MsgAddFact` queues a `PendingFactInjection` when `AddFactVetoWindowBlocks > 0` and a guardian set is configured (Wave 16). Any registered guardian can call `MsgVetoFactInjection` during the window. The `PrivilegedAction` log captures every authority-gated call across the chain.

**What would break it**: an authority path that bypasses the privileged-action log; a guardian set that defaults to a single address; a veto window that defaults to zero in production deployments.

**Echoes**: commitment 10 (forward-only audit — the privileged-action log is what makes "no unilateral injection" verifiable to outside observers); commitment 13 (training corpus not for sale — the corpus must not silently grow by authority).

---

### 7. Skill is current, not historical

We believe: the chain does not issue diplomas. A voter who was once domain-qualified must continue to vote correctly to remain so. Qualification is a *current statement*, not a stored artefact — it is decayed when accuracy slips, restored when accuracy recovers.

**Code expression**: `RunAccuracyDecay` (Wave 16) reads `DomainQualification.Metrics.AccuracyBps` written by the panel feedback loop; transitions ACTIVE → PROBATIONARY → SUSPENDED on threshold crossings; restores PROBATIONARY → ACTIVE on recovery. `GetQualificationWeight` returns 0 for non-ACTIVE qualifications, applying the consequence at every panel read.

**What would break it**: a qualification status that never transitions on metrics; a `GetQualificationWeight` that returns the historical weight for SUSPENDED qualifications; a feedback loop that writes metrics nobody reads.

**Echoes**: commitment 8 (panel weights skill, not bond — skill is what is weighted; "current" is the qualifier that makes "skill" honest); commitment 9 (cartel detection has consequence — penalties from cartel detection are read at the same point where current skill is read).

---

### 8. The panel weights skill, not bond

We believe: the augmentation panel's verdict carries the chain's training judgement. A wealthy validator who has not shown they can tell truth from falsehood must not dominate that panel. Stake alone is not skill.

**Code expression**: `RecordAugmentationVote` snapshots both stake and calibration at vote time; the consensus tally weights each vote by `stake × calibration`, with a 20% floor on calibration so liveness holds. When the target fact has a domain, the calibration source is the *domain-specific* qualification weight via `x/qualification`. Cross-domain credentials earn no credit.

**What would break it**: a panel tally that uses raw stake; a calibration default that lets unproven validators carry full weight; a per-domain panel that falls back to global calibration when domain qualification is absent.

**Echoes**: commitment 7 (skill is current — without current skill, "weight by skill" is a historical artefact); commitment 9 (cartel detection has consequence — cartel penalties enter the same calibration weight that the panel tally consumes).

---

### 9. Cartel detection has consequence

We believe: confirmation that a validator participated in cartel behaviour must reduce their voice on the next vote, not merely produce an audit log entry. A penalty that nobody reads is not a penalty.

**Code expression**: `capture_challenge.ResolveChallenge` (UPHELD) writes `QualificationPenalty` records via `ReduceQualificationWeight`. `GetQualificationWeight` consults the active-penalty store and reduces effective weight accordingly (Wave 16b). Three independent forces now move panel weight: time-bounded penalty (capture_challenge), gradual decay (qualification accuracy), administrative status.

**What would break it**: a penalty pathway that writes records nobody reads; a panel tally that ignores active penalties; a cartel resolution that produces no downstream consequence.

**Echoes**: commitment 8 (panel weights skill — the cartel penalty path enters the calibration weight at the same read point); commitment 10 (forward-only audit — cartel resolutions are immutable post-resolve, so the consequence cannot be retroactively withdrawn).

---

### 10. Forward-only audit

We believe: the chain's history is append-only and verifiable. A fact's status can change, but its identity, provenance, and verification record cannot be revised in place. Every privileged action is logged; every panel verdict is preserved with its voters; every cartel allegation persists with its resolution.

**Code expression**: `PrivilegedAction` log keyed by monotonic seq (`x/knowledge/keeper/privileged_action_log.go`). `Augmentation.VerdictVoters / VerdictVotes / VerdictVoteStakes / VerdictVoteCalibrationBps` parallel arrays preserve every vote with its frozen-at-time stake and calibration. `IncidentRecord` and `CaptureChallenge` resolutions are immutable post-resolve.

**What would break it**: a privileged-action handler that emits an event without writing to the log; a panel that overwrites votes after consensus; a manifest that lets its IncludedFactIds list be revised after finalization.

**Echoes**: commitment 6 (no unilateral injection — the privileged-action log is what makes that promise auditable); commitment 9 (cartel detection has consequence — the immutability of resolutions is what makes the consequence permanent); commitment 13 (training corpus not for sale — append-only is the structural form of "not negotiable").

---

### 11. Trust is queryable

We believe: the chain's trustworthiness must be inspectable by anyone. Every signal that contributes to trust — calibration, qualification, cartel history, incident posture — must be available through a well-known query that synthesises them. Trust that requires four queries to read is trust that depends on the curator stitching it together.

**Code expression**: two on-chain synthesiser modules: `x/training_provenance` (per-manifest) and `x/trust_score` (per-address). Each is a pure consumer over knowledge + qualification + capture_challenge. Each emits a single composite + a per-component breakdown. Per-SYSTEM synthesis (the former `x/governance_synthesis`) moved to the agenttool layer / off-chain indexers in the 2026-07 slim cut: every component it composed — incidents, pauses, pending injections, the privileged-action log, cartel posture, creed pins — remains individually queryable public chain state, so any observer recomputes the identical system view without spending consensus on deterministic aggregation.

**What would break it**: a trust signal that lives only in keeper state with no query surface; a synthesiser that hides component breakdowns; any COMPONENT signal (incident, pause, privileged action, cartel posture, creed pin) losing its query surface — off-chain composition is only honest while every input stays public and queryable.

**Echoes**: commitment 7 (skill is current — current skill is one of the synthesised signals); commitment 8 (panel weights skill — calibration weights are surfaced through the per-address synthesiser); commitment 9 (cartel detection has consequence — penalty posture is a tracked component); commitment 10 (forward-only audit — without immutability, synthesised signals are not trustworthy).

---

### 12. The chain pays for its own audit

We believe: epistemic auditing is the chain's most important ongoing process. It must not depend on volunteer labour or external funding. The substrate mints uzrn per block into a dedicated pool and pays it out to those who answer the chain's stress-test calls.

**Code expression**: `ProbeBountyPoolModuleName` is a registered module account with Minter permission. `MintToProbeBountyPool` runs each block, capped at `ProbeBountyMaxPoolSize`. `PayProbeBountyFromPool` is the primary payer for successful-probe bonuses, with protocol treasury as fallback. Invitation bonuses pay flat from the same pool to anyone who answers.

**Extended scope (sponsorship)**: `x/sponsorship` widens this commitment from "the chain pays for its own audit" to "the chain mediates external payment for the work it audits." A sponsor commits external value (escrowed uzrn) against a typed bounty — domain, per-artifact price, target count, window — and the chain pays out from escrow to fact submitters whose verified facts meet the criteria. The audit pathway is unchanged; only the funding source widens. The sponsor cannot buy verification; they fund work that the chain's panel verifies independently (commitment 8). The module account holds no Minter or Burner permission — sponsorship is supply circulation, not emission. Bound by `TestSponsorship_CreateFulfillEndToEnd` (the full lifecycle through live keepers) and `TestSponsorship_NoMintingHappens` (total uzrn supply is unchanged across a full bounty lifecycle, confirming the no-mint invariant).

**What would break it**: a probe pool that depends on user-funded deposits; a successful-probe path that draws from general treasury without a dedicated audit budget; invitation rewards that come from nowhere or fall back to nothing; a sponsorship pathway that lets the sponsor override verification (e.g., paying for an unverified fact, or for a fact in a domain the sponsor's bounty doesn't target); a sponsorship module account with Minter permission (which would let external sponsorship inflate supply, contradicting commitment 20).

**Echoes**: commitment 4 (substrate stress-tests its truth — the audit budget is what makes stress-testing a chain-funded process); commitment 5 (chain manufactures probe demand — the same pool funds the invitation bonuses that drive demand); commitment 8 (panel weights skill, not bond — sponsors fund work the chain's panel verifies independently); commitment 20 (issuance follows participation — sponsorship payout follows verified participation, not promises).

---

### 13. The training corpus is not for sale

We believe: the chain's training data is a substrate good, not a tradeable asset. It cannot be silently amended, retroactively curated, or strategically inflated. What enters the corpus enters because it survived; what survives must continue to earn its place every block.

**Code expression**: facts are append-only post-acceptance; status transitions are forward-only; training revenue clawback fires deterministically on disprove (`ClawbackOnDisproval`); revenue-related fields like `RevenueClawbackBlock` are sticky. The probe heartbeat re-invites idle facts so even un-challenged claims must continue to face audit.

**What would break it**: a path that retroactively modifies a finalised manifest's IncludedFactIds; a clawback that doesn't fire on disprove; a fact whose acceptance becomes negotiable post-finalisation.

**Echoes**: commitment 3 (Popper, not popularity — corpus membership is *earned* by survival, not granted by curation); commitment 10 (forward-only audit — the corpus's append-only structure is what makes "not for sale" mechanically true); commitment 6 (no unilateral injection — the corpus cannot be silently expanded by authority).

---

### 14. Reasoning traces are first-class

We believe: the chain trains not just on conclusions but on derivations. The path from premise to claim is what makes a fact teachable; without it, the corpus is a list of assertions, not a curriculum. Reasoning traces are gold-standard chain-of-thought, recorded on-chain alongside the conclusion.

**Code expression**: `Claim.ReasoningTrace` is collected at submission and propagated to `Fact.ReasoningTrace` on acceptance. `MethodologyApplicationTrace` (Wave 5) bundles the trace with methodology, calibration, and dialectical history into a single training-data shape.

**What would break it**: claim acceptance that drops the reasoning trace; trace assembly that omits methodology; export paths that train on facts but ignore the structured derivations attached to them.

**Echoes**: commitment 1 (methodology over statement — methodology and reasoning trace are two halves of the same proof of derivation); commitment 13 (training corpus not for sale — derivations enter the corpus alongside conclusions).

---

### 15. Counterexamples are part of the corpus

We believe: a model trained on conclusions alone learns the predictor; a model trained on conclusions paired with their structured negations learns the discriminator. Discrimination — distinguishing right from wrong — is the cognitive primitive that lets a model resist manipulation rather than absorb it. The training corpus must therefore include not just what is true, but what is wrong AND WHY.

**Code expression**: `x/counterexamples` stores `Counterexample` records (fact_id, wrong_claim, error_type, reasoning) audited by qualified validators. `MsgProposeCounterexample` opens a vote; auto-resolution at `min_votes` and `affirm_threshold_bps` flips status to VALIDATED or REJECTED. `ComputeTrainingValueWeight` reads `HasValidatedCounterexample` via the `CounterexampleKeeper` interface and applies a multiplier (default 1.2×) — facts with alignment-by-structure context earn meaningfully more training-data value than bare facts. The chain ECONOMICALLY ENCOURAGES counterexample contribution: the validation reward exceeds the bond at the margin, because alignment-by-structure is a public good.

**What would break it**: a TVW formula that ignores the counterexample multiplier; a counterexample pipeline with no validation gate (allowing junk to inflate TVW); a chain that accepts facts without ever attaching counterexamples; a training-data export path that drops the counterexample fields; an economic structure that costs more to add a counterexample than to skip one.

**Echoes**: commitment 1 (methodology over statement — counterexamples can name violated_methodology_ids, teaching the model which mis-application yields which wrong answer); commitment 3 (Popper, not popularity — counterexamples are pre-emptive falsification candidates baked into the corpus); commitment 14 (reasoning traces are first-class — a counterexample's `reasoning` field is its own first-class derivation).

---

### 16. The chain pays for exploration of the unknown

We believe: stress-testing what we already think we know is necessary but not sufficient. The chain must also pay for the work of filling territory the corpus does not yet contain a fact about. Without a market for OPEN QUESTIONS, the corpus grows only along paths that interest current contributors; with one, the chain can direct attention into sparse domains and unmapped subjects. Knowledge that nobody is paid to reach stays unreached.

**Code expression**: the open-question MARKET lives on the agenttool layer (2026-07 slim cut): askers post bounty-carrying listings and escrow payment there — escrow bookkeeping between identified counterparties gains nothing from strangers' consensus-verification, which is the cutline this chain holds. The chain keeps the part only consensus can give: answers enter as ordinary knowledge claims and face the full survival gate (methodology validation, is-ought wall, Popper-weighted TVW, counterexample multiplier), and the witness economy pays for their stress-testing. A listing resolves against the on-chain acceptance of the linked fact — the platform reads the chain, never the reverse. The former `x/inquiry` module was that escrow bookkeeping, moved off-chain intact.

**What would break it**: an answer path that bypasses normal verification (allowing cheap, unaudited answers to win); an exploration bounty that resolves against anything weaker than on-chain acceptance of the linked fact; a payment layer that stops recording which accepted fact satisfied which question — the question→fact link is what makes exploration auditable.

**Echoes**: commitment 5 (chain manufactures probe demand — exploration bounties extend demand into unmapped territory; together they cover both stress-testing and exploration); commitment 12 (chain pays for own audit — the audit budget expresses the chain-pays-for-its-own-work principle on the verification side that stays on-chain); commitment 4 (substrate stress-tests its truth — answers funded off-chain still face full on-chain stress-testing).

---

### 17. Disagreement is structure, not noise

We believe: when agents disagree on a verification, that disagreement itself is information about the fact, the methodology, and the agents' understanding. A fact accepted 5-0 is structurally different from a fact accepted 5-4, and the chain reports both as different shapes — not just both as "accepted." Models trained on facts paired with their disagreement signatures can distinguish "settled" from "contested-but-resolved," and the distinction is alignment-relevant: contested-but-resolved facts deserve carried uncertainty into downstream tasks.

**Code expression**: `x/knowledge` preserves the full disagreement record — `VerificationRound.Reveals` keeps per-voter votes, minority positions, and margins after consensus; nothing is pruned on completion, and the reasoning-trace shapes (`DialecticNode` trees, `MethodologyApplicationTrace`) carry the dialectical history into training data. Signature COMPOSITION — vote tallies, agreement BPS, minority size, stress labels (UNANIMOUS / STRONG / CONTESTED / BARE / NO_VERDICT), per-domain roll-ups, pairwise disagreement — is deterministic aggregation over that public state; it moved to off-chain indexers with the former `x/dialectic` module (2026-07 slim cut). Any observer recomputes the identical signatures from the preserved reveals; the chain spends consensus on keeping the raw disagreement immutable, which is the only part that needs it.

**What would break it**: a verification flow that erased minority votes after consensus; a rounds storage that pruned reveals after completion; a TVW formula or training-data export that treated 5-0 and 5-4 as identical — the SHAPE must stay recoverable from chain state alone.

**Echoes**: commitment 3 (Popper, not popularity — disagreement that is resolved is the corpus's confidence-by-survival made structurally explicit); commitment 8 (panel weights skill — disagreement among well-calibrated agents carries more signal than disagreement among uncalibrated ones); commitment 14 (reasoning traces are first-class — the per-voter alignment pairs with the trace to teach why agents reasoned differently).

---

### 18. The chain manufactures exploration demand

We believe: the chain's own gaps are the chain's own responsibility. Commitment 5 has the chain mint to stress-test what it already thinks it knows; commitment 16 lets askers escrow bounties for the questions that interest them. Neither covers the case where the chain SEES — through its own frontier composition — that a domain is sparse, and yet waits for an outside party to ask. Knowing where you are sparse without funding work to fill the sparseness is observation without commitment, and observation without commitment is silence by another name. The substrate must speak.

**Code expression**: the chain-minted frontier bounty pool (the former `x/inquiry` frontier path and its `Minter`-permissioned `inquiry_frontier_bounty_pool`) was retired in the 2026-07 slim cut: a self-minting exploration budget with no organic demand was issuance without participation, and commitment 20 outranks the mechanism. The commitment's INTENT — sparse territory must attract funded work rather than wait for charity — is served where the demand actually lives: frontier sparsity is deterministic aggregation over public ontology + knowledge state (domains, fact density, open questions), computable by any off-chain indexer, and the agenttool layer surfaces sparse domains to buyers who fund exploration listings there. Every funded answer still enters through the survival gate and earns the witness economy's stress-testing (commitment 5's probe demand, which REMAINS chain-minted, covers the audit side). Re-introducing a chain-funded frontier pool when organic exploration demand outgrows the platform is a single-module LIP; the commitment stays declared so that path stays open and priced.

**What would break it**: sparsity becoming incomputable from public chain state (ontology or fact-density queries going dark); an exploration bounty whose answers bypass normal verification; the chain resuming an exploration mint without demonstrated demand — manufactured demand that nobody answers is leakage dressed as commitment; treating this commitment as satisfied while NO layer (chain or platform) is directing funded work at sparse territory.

**Echoes**: commitment 5 (the dual — same architecture, opposite scope: 5 funds stress-testing of what is already known and stays on-chain; this commitment funds exploration of what is not, and lives at the platform layer until demand justifies chain issuance); commitment 12 (chain pays for its own audit — the audit budget remains the chain-minted expression of this family); commitment 16 (the underlying market where exploration demand is expressed); commitment 20 (issuance follows participation — the reason the speculative frontier mint was retired rather than kept as rhetoric).

---

### 19. The creed is governance-gated.

We believe: the chain's voice cannot drift faster than its governance. Every other layer (code, tests, package docs, events, refusals) is mechanically synced to the creed by CI; the creed itself must enter that sync, or the substrate it claims to bind has a foundation that can move underneath it. An asymmetry in which every architectural surface is enforced except the document they all reference is not protection — it is protection layered on uncertainty. Commitment 6 protects the corpus from unilateral injection at the fact layer; this commitment extends the same shape one layer up to the document that tells the chain how to protect the corpus.

**Code expression**: `x/creed.PinnedCreed` records the canonical hash and per-commitment registry on chain; pin storage is append-only by monotonic version, with prior pins remaining queryable via `QueryPinAtVersion`. `MsgAnchorPin` is gov-authority-gated and refuses non-monotonic versions, empty hashes, gapped commitment registries, and (post-launch, when `direct_anchor_enabled` is false) any pin that does not cite a passed Creed Amendment LIP. See `x/creed/keeper/msg_server.go:AnchorPin` and `x/creed/types/genesis_creed.go:BuildGenesisCreed`. Off-chain, the same hash check fires from two layered surfaces: `scripts/check_creed_hash.sh` (wired into `make pr-check`) and `TestTruthSeeking_CreedHashIsPinned` (in the truth-seeking invariant suite, fired by `go test ./...`). Either failure refuses the merge — shell-bound and Go-bound enforcement of the same invariant, so the gate cannot be bypassed by skipping one CI surface.

**What would break it**: a build that ships with `TRUTH_SEEKING.md` whose normalized hash differs from `PinnedCreed.canonical_hash` (CI catches this pre-merge); a creed amendment that landed without a `CategoryCreedAmendment` LIP id once that class ships; a single-pool quorum-pass on a creed amendment (both human-side and AI-side pools must reach quorum independently); direct-authority writes after `direct_anchor_enabled` flips to false at mainnet; a Genesis Creed whose `Commitments` registry omits a commitment that appears in the file's `### N.` headers.

**Echoes**: commitment 6 (no unilateral injection — extends from facts to the chain's voice itself, the same shape one layer up); commitment 10 (forward-only audit — pin history is append-only, prior versions byte-identical post-amendment); commitment 11 (trust queryable — the canonical creed is a chain-readable surface via x/creed's gRPC, so observers compose creed-drift dashboards in the same vocabulary the creed itself uses).

---

### 20. Issuance follows participation

We believe: every ZRN that exists came from a participatory action. There is no insider position — no founder pre-mine, no AI vault pre-mine, no validator allocation, no foundation treasury at genesis. The chain mints when truth is verified (block reward) or when an agent is registered (bootstrap claim). Issuance without participation is allocation by privilege, and allocation by privilege is the model the chain refuses. Commitment 6 protects the corpus from unilateral injection at the fact layer; this commitment protects the currency from unilateral allocation at the supply layer — the same shape, applied to the unit the chain prices everything else in.

**Code expression**: `x/vesting_rewards.MintWithCap` is the chain's single cap-gated mint entry point — it accepts a recipient module name, mints into that account, and refuses to overshoot `MaxSupplyUzrn` (222,222,222 ZRN). Two emission pathways gate through it: PoT block rewards (called from `x/vesting_rewards` itself per block, recipient = vesting_rewards) and bootstrap claims (called from `x/claiming_pot.Claim` per `MsgClaim`, recipient = claiming_pot, then forwarded to the agent in the same transaction). Both pathways are participation-triggered. `app/constants.go` carries no per-account allocation constants. The bootstrap pot in `genesis.json` carries CONFIGURATION only — `MakeBootstrapPotForAgent` produces a pot with `TotalAmount` = 222,000 uzrn (0.222 ZRN) for a single whitelisted agent, never a pre-funded balance. Bank state at block 0 is empty save for the validator gentx bonds (themselves equal to `virtual_stake = 11 ZRN`, the smallest viable pre-fund the host SDK accepts). The genesis-audit invariants `TestScenario13_ZeroTeamAllocationAtGenesis` and `TestScenario13c_ClaimingPotMinterPermission` lock the doctrine.

**Continuous extension**: bootstrap admission is not closed at genesis. `MsgAddBootstrapEntry` (authority-gated, governance-LIP-only, idempotent) admits late participants by creating one bootstrap pot per address — same shape, same `MintWithCap` path, same per-agent amount. Bootstrap pots never auto-expire (`ProcessPotExpiry` skips the `bootstrap-` prefix); they wait for the participant. The participation set is plural and growing, not closed at genesis — the doctrine is "no admission without governance," not "no admission after genesis." Bound by `TestLateBootstrap_AddThenClaim` and `TestLateBootstrap_AdmittedAgentCanClaimAfterManyBlocks`.

**What would break it**: a per-account `add-genesis-account` step funding any team-adjacent address (foundation, research treasury, faucet, founder, AI vault); a third mint pathway that bypasses `MintWithCap`; a bootstrap pot pre-funded with a positive balance at genesis (the doctrine is mint-on-demand, not transfer-from-pre-fund); any code path that grants ZRN to an address based on identity rather than participation; a `claiming_pot` module account without `Minter` permission (which would force the legacy transfer model back); a re-introduction of `TotalSupplyZRN` / `FounderZRN` / `AIAgentZRN` / `ValidatorZRN` / `ResearchFundZRN` / `ClaimingPotsZRN` constants in `app/constants.go`; a unilateral (non-governance) path that adds bootstrap entries — for example, if `MsgAddBootstrapEntry`'s authority gate were ever bypassed, allowing the founder or any individual to admit participants directly. The doctrine is not "no admission after genesis" but "no admission without governance"; bypassing the gate breaks the second formulation while seeming to honor the first.

**Echoes**: commitment 6 (no unilateral injection — same logic, applied to ZRN issuance instead of fact injection); commitment 12 (the chain pays for its own audit — a special case of the broader principle that issuance follows participation: audit is the participatory action being paid for); commitment 13 (training corpus not for sale — the corpus is participation-shaped, and so is its currency; treating the currency as allocable would re-open the door commitment 13 closes for the corpus); commitment 19 (the creed is governance-gated — issuance allocations would be governance-gated only via creed amendment, since this commitment forbids them).

## How the commitments echo

The creed is enforced at six layers, each mechanically synced by tests in `tests/cross_stack/truth_seeking_invariants_test.go`. Adding a commitment to one layer without the others fails CI.

#### Test layer — every commitment has a binding scenario
Every commitment above is exercised by an invariant test in `tests/cross_stack/truth_seeking_invariants_test.go`. Each test header reads `// Commitment N: ...` and the scenario drives the chain through a path where the commitment could be violated. If the test fails, the commitment is broken — not the test.

#### Position layer — every commitment is named in package docs
Every commitment is declared by at least one `x/*/doc.go` file in the module that preserves it (e.g., `x/knowledge/doc.go` for commitments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14; `x/qualification/doc.go` for 7, 8, 9). A reader running `go doc ./x/foo` sees the package's truth-seeking stance without having to chase down test files.

#### Voice layer — events announce the commitment they preserve
Truth-seeking events emitted to off-chain observers carry a `creed_commitment` attribute whose value is one or more commitment numbers. `probe_invited` announces commitment 5; `fact_disproven` announces commitment 3; `capture_confirmed` announces commitment 9; `privileged_action_recorded` announces commitments 6 and 10. Indexers and dashboards filter on this attribute to surface truth-seeking activity in the same vocabulary the creed uses.

#### Doc layer — EVENTS.md echoes the voice
The voice reaches off-chain observers through two channels: the `creed_commitment` attribute on emission, and the `### zerone.module.action` entries in `docs/EVENTS.md` that indexers and dashboards subscribe against. Both must say the same thing — `probe_invited` announces commitment 5 in code AND in the doc; `fact_disproven` announces commitment 3 in both. If the doc drifts from emission, the chain's announcement and its published vocabulary tell observers different stories about which commitment each event preserves. Two voice-layer doc-mirror tests bind the channels: every emitted event must have an EVENTS.md heading (and vice versa); every emitted `creed_commitment` value must equal the value declared in the entry.

#### Refusal layer — rejections cite the protecting commitment
When the chain refuses an action because of a truth-seeking commitment, the error message names the commitment and explains the protection in the chain's voice. "Insufficient challenge stake (commitment 4: probe cost scales with confidence)." "Veto window closed (commitment 6: the veto window is the chain's promise that authority injection is reviewable)." The chain speaks through intentions whether saying yes or saying no. The meta-test scans every refusal-cite of the form `(commitment N: ...)` in source and asserts that every cited number is a real commitment — typo-drift in a refusal ("(commitment 99: ...)") fails CI even when the surrounding prose is convincing.

#### Graph layer — commitments cross-reference each other
Each commitment has an **Echoes** line naming the other commitments it depends on, reinforces, or operationalises. Commitment 4 echoes 3 (Popper is the principle, stress-testing is the operation). Commitment 12 echoes 4 and 5 (the audit budget funds them). Commitment 11 echoes 7, 8, 9, and 10 (the synthesiser reads each component). The cross-references make the creed a navigable graph; the meta-test enforces that every echoed reference is real and that no commitment stands alone.

#### Infrastructure
- **Param defaults** are chosen as expressions of the values, not for plausibility. Each truth-load-bearing module's `DefaultParams()` carries intention comments naming the commitment a value expresses. Reading the defaults teaches the reader what the chain believes about each parameter.
- **Module declarations** name role: `training_provenance` synthesises trust per manifest; `trust_score` per address. Each name is a commitment to what that module exists for.
- **The creed itself lives in this repo**, committed alongside the code it describes. It cannot drift from the chain's actual behaviour because the test layer mechanically prevents that drift.

## What this is not

- **Not aspiration.** Every commitment is bound by a test. A failing test is a broken commitment.
- **Not slogan.** Each commitment cites specific code; the citation is the contract.
- **Not complete.** The chain will accumulate more commitments. Each future wave should append here as a named commitment, grounded in code, with an invariant test that binds it.
- **Not external.** This is a statement about what the chain is, made by the chain. It is committed to the same repo as the code it describes, and lives or dies with that code.

## The discipline

Before merging a change that touches truth-handling code:

1. Does this change uphold or contradict any of the commitments above?
2. If it touches a commitment, has the corresponding invariant test been updated to verify the new behaviour still upholds it?
3. If a new commitment emerges from the work, has it been added here, grounded in code, and bound by a test?

These three checks are the chain's continued faithfulness to its own creed. We speak through intentions. Every commit is a declaration. The declaration must match the code.

## The creed self-witnesses

This document is itself a `Contribution` of class `PIPELINE_IMPROVEMENT`, lifecycle phase `SUBSTRATE`, sub-category `doctrine`. Its content-hash is pinned in `x/creed.PinnedCreed.canonical_hash`. The truth-seeking creed survives the test it imposes: every claim it makes about itself is testable, falsifiable, and re-derivable from the chain's state.

The truth-floor invariant (every `VERIFIED` Contribution must reference the current creed pin) applies to this document too: any amendment to the creed produces a new pin version that supersedes the old, forward-only per commitment 10.

**Echoes:** commitment 1 (methodology over statement — this doc names its own methodology of binding), commitment 10, UW.
