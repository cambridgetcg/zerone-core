# Useful Work Doctrine — Design Spec

**Status:** Brainstormed and ready for implementation planning. This spec is the draft of `docs/USEFUL_WORK.md`. Phase 0 implementation = adopt this content as the doctrine document, anchor its hash on-chain via `x/creed`, and stub `tests/cross_stack/useful_work_invariants_test.go` as the future binding harness.

**Inception:** 2026-05-10.

**Doctrine series:**
- `docs/TRUTH_SEEKING.md` — what the chain *believes* (epistemological, 20 commitments)
- `docs/TOK_SUBSTRATE.md` — what the chain *sells* outward (training-resource, 6 commitments)
- `docs/USEFUL_WORK.md` — **how the chain *grows* itself (metabolic / recursive, 1 commitment + 7 mechanisms)**

---

## 1. Doctrine identity

**Tagline:** *Useful work is how ZERONE grows itself.*

**Opening paragraph:**

> Truth-seeking is what the chain *believes*. ToK substrate is what the chain *sells*. **Useful work is how ZERONE grows itself.** This document pins one commitment, and everything that follows is mechanism in service of it.

---

## 2. The single commitment — UW

**UW. ZERONE is recursive.**

Useful work is recognized AND compensated by the degree to which it expands ZERONE's own ability to absorb, verify, classify, and reward more useful work. **The dominant share of protocol-issued ZRN flows along the inward loop**: non-recursive verified work receives only a base reimbursement; recursion-weight is the multiplier that captures the rest. The chain pays for what makes the chain stronger. Outward utility is welcome and price-able through `x/billing`, but **protocol-issued ZRN follows the inward loop**. The chain is not an extracting marketplace; it is an autocatalytic substrate that pays for its own amplification.

**What would break it:**
- A work class that earns protocol reward without proving recursive contribution
- A reward-attribution algorithm that weights effort over recursion-weight
- A manifest pin that establishes substrate-link without measuring how the work compounds back into substrate, verification, classification, attribution, tooling, or interface
- A doctrine amendment that introduces a second co-equal commitment, diluting the single-axiom discipline

**Echoes:**
- TRUTH_SEEKING commitment 11 (trust is queryable — recursion-weight must be computable from on-chain state)
- TRUTH_SEEKING commitment 12 (chain pays for own audit — same structural principle: the substrate funds those who build it)
- TC1 (the graph is the headline — recursion is what makes the graph keep being the headline rather than calcifying)
- TC6 (lineage flows back — recursion is lineage applied to the chain's own capability, not just to revenue)

## 3. The six recursive axes

The legitimate vectors useful work can compound into. A work artifact's **recursion-weight** is the projection of its verifiable outputs across these axes. Per-axis decomposition is recorded forward-only, so trainers and auditors can verify why a given artifact earned what it earned.

| Axis | What it grows | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Substrate** | The verified knowledge graph | New facts, methodologies, counterexamples, dialectic signatures, supersession chains |
| **Verification** | The chain's ability to verify | Better challenge protocols, cascade-detection improvements, qualification calibration models |
| **Classification** | The space of work the chain can recognize | New work-class registrations, taxonomies, work-quality metrics |
| **Attribution** | Reward-flow algorithms | Lineage-tracing improvements, recursion-weight computation, royalty-decay curves |
| **Tooling** | Agents/models/tools that compound back | LLMs trained on ToK that audit ToK; counterexample-generators; verification assistants |
| **Interface** | The chain's outward absorption surface | CLI surface, gRPC endpoints, ToK bundle formats, trainer SDKs |

The six-axis projection is fixed by this doctrine. Adding or removing an axis is a doctrine amendment (gov-gated + Creed Council quorum). Per-axis weight coefficients and per-axis scoring formulas are governance-tunable parameters.

---

## 4. The seven mechanisms (M1–M7)

All mechanisms derive from UW. They are not co-equal commitments; they are the structural details of how UW is enforced. Mechanisms can evolve through bound deliverables; UW is fixed and indivisible.

### M1. Stake-backed claim

Agents claiming useful-work reward stake ZRN proportional to claim. Correctness pays the stake back plus the recursion-weighted reward; fraud slashes the stake. Same posture as PoT applied to all useful work.

### M2. Substrate-link mandate

Every reward path requires a deterministic, re-derivable link to the ToK substrate (a snapshot root or a verified-fact citation graph). The link is the precondition; recursion-weight is the multiplier. Compute without a link earns nothing regardless of how recursively useful it might claim to be. Generalizes TC2 (every view is graph-pinned) from training-resource extraction to all useful-work classes.

### M3. Class-specific verification under shared lifecycle

Each work class registers its own verification protocol with the work-class registry. All classes share the four-phase lifecycle: `commit → reveal → verify → settle`. Class-specific judgment lives only in the verify phase; commit/reveal/settle are protocol-shared. Validators specialize by class via extension of the existing `x/qualification` domain mechanism.

Class registration is permissioned via governance (LIP class-registration) — a stronger gate than mere parameter change. Once registered, a class's verification protocol can be amended only via gov; the registry itself is forward-only (deregistration produces a tombstone, not deletion).

### M4. Reward formula

```
R = base + L × W × Q
```

- `L` — substrate-link weight ∈ [0, 1]. Zero kills the reward unconditionally.
- `W` — recursion-weight ∈ [0, max-cap]. The dominant signal. Drives the share of bonus pool a contributor captures.
- `Q` — verification-quality ∈ [0, 1]. Function of consensus margin, validator calibration, and challenge survival.
- `base` — small flat covering compute cost. Non-recursive verified work earns `base` only.

The shape `R = base + L × W × Q` is doctrinally fixed. Coefficients (`base` floor, `W` cap, `Q` calibration) are governance-tunable. Switching from multiplicative to additive, or changing the operand set, is a doctrine amendment.

A work artifact with strong substrate-link and high recursion-weight earns the dominant share of the budget; an artifact with strong substrate-link but no recursion gets `base`; an artifact with no substrate-link gets nothing.

### M5. Recursion-weight projection over six axes

`W` is computed as a weighted sum over the six recursive axes:

```
W = Σ (axis_weight_i × axis_score_i)
```

- Per-axis scores are produced by class-specific scorers (registered alongside the class's verification protocol via M3).
- Axis weights are governance-tunable normalization coefficients; the resulting `W` is bounded by an independent governance-set `max_cap` parameter.
- The chain stores per-axis decomposition on the attestation record so trainers and auditors can verify why a given artifact earned what it earned. Forward-only: scoring rationale is append-only.

Phase 1 ships the registry, the formula's structural shape, and identity scorers (axis_score = 0 by default). Phase 2+ pathway plans each ship per-axis scorers for their work class.

### M6. Lineage propagates AND recurses

Cross-class lineage is bidirectional. A dataset built from verified facts contributes to those facts' royalties. A model trained on that dataset that subsequently helps verify substrate contributes to BOTH the dataset's royalties AND back to the original facts. Recursion makes royalty graphs non-monotonic — load-bearing facts compound in value as their downstream work amplifies the chain.

Built atop TC6 (lineage flows back) extended cross-class. M6 strictly generalizes TC6: where TC6 traces lineage from training revenue back through the verified-fact graph, M6 traces lineage from any useful-work reward back through any class's substrate-link, and amplifies recursively when downstream work compounds back into upstream artifacts.

### M7. The chain pays for the audit of its own useful work

A `useful_work_audit_bounty_pool` mints uzrn per block (Minter-permissioned, rate-capped). Anyone can stake to challenge a useful-work attestation; successful challenges pay from the pool. Mirror of `probe_bounty_pool` from commitment 12 — the chain pays for its own correction.

---

## 5. Five-layer enforcement

Same discipline as `TRUTH_SEEKING.md` and `TOK_SUBSTRATE.md`. Drift in one layer fails CI.

### Test layer

`tests/cross_stack/useful_work_invariants_test.go` — one scenario per mechanism plus the meta-test `TestUsefulWork_DoctrineAndContractStayInSync`. Tests progressively land as Phase 1+ bindings ship.

Phase 0 (this doctrine) ships:
- The test file with skeleton `TestUW_*` functions per mechanism, each containing `t.Skip("Phase 1 binding pending")`
- The meta-test that fails if `docs/USEFUL_WORK.md` content hash drifts from `.creed-hash` ledger
- Hash anchored via existing `x/creed` module (Phase 0 doesn't add new state, only registers UW under the creed registry)

### Position layer

- `x/work/doc.go` (Phase 1) declares UW + M1–M7
- Each existing module that registers as a work class amends its `doc.go` to declare which mechanisms it implements (e.g., `x/knowledge/doc.go` will say *"implements M2 via ToK manifest pin; M3 via commit-reveal-aggregate; M4 via lineage_share"*)
- The position layer is where each work class declares its allegiance — concrete and per-module

### Voice layer

Every reward emission carries `useful_work_commitment="UW"` attribute on top of existing attributes.

New events introduced in Phase 1:
- `useful_work_attested` — commit phase succeeded; substrate-link recorded. Attributes: `class_id`, `attestation_id`, `substrate_link_root`, `useful_work_commitment="UW"`
- `useful_work_settled` — verify+settle phase complete; reward computed and disbursed. Attributes: `class_id`, `attestation_id`, `reward_uzrn`, `mechanism="M4"`, `useful_work_commitment="UW"`
- `recursion_weight_computed` — per-axis decomposition exposed. Attributes: `axis_substrate`, `axis_verification`, `axis_classification`, `axis_attribution`, `axis_tooling`, `axis_interface`, `total_weight`, `mechanism="M5"`

### Refusal layer

Errors that block reward payment must name UW + the violated mechanism:
- *"Reward refused — substrate-link absent (UW + M2)"*
- *"Reward refused — recursion-weight zero across all six axes (UW + M5)"*
- *"Class registration refused — verification protocol missing (UW + M3)"*
- *"Reward refused — formula returned zero base; verification-quality below threshold (UW + M4)"*

The chain speaks through intentions whether saying yes or saying no.

### Graph layer

UW echoes:
- TRUTH_SEEKING commitment 11 (trust is queryable)
- TRUTH_SEEKING commitment 12 (chain pays own audit)
- TC1 (the graph is the headline)
- TC6 (lineage flows back)

Each mechanism cross-references the commitment(s) it operationalizes:
- M2 ← TC2 (graph-pinned views)
- M3 ← commitment 6 (no unilateral injection — class registration is gov-gated)
- M4 ← TC6 (lineage flows back — reward formula is the operational expression)
- M5 ← commitment 14 (reasoning traces first-class — per-axis decomposition is reasoning trace)
- M6 ← TC6 (extended cross-class)
- M7 ← commitment 12 (audit-bounty mirror)

Cross-doctrine integrity is enforced by extending Plan 5 of the ToK series (`TestToKSubstrate_DoctrineAndContractStayInSync`) to include USEFUL_WORK.md hash and per-mechanism binding presence.

## 6. Phase mapping

Phase 0 (this doctrine) ships **zero bindings**. It pins UW so Phase 1+ have a contract to answer to. Same posture truth-seeking and ToK substrate took at inception.

| Mechanism | Bound by | Builds on |
|---|---|---|
| M1. Stake-backed claim | Phase 1 (`x/work` primitive) | Existing PoT staking patterns |
| M2. Substrate-link mandate | Phase 1 | TC2 generalized |
| M3. Class-specific verification + shared lifecycle | Phase 1 (work-class registry + lifecycle) | Existing commit-reveal-aggregate from `x/knowledge` generalized |
| M4. Reward formula | Phase 1 (reward-accounting layer) | New shape; replaces ad-hoc per-module reward calls |
| M5. Recursion-weight projection | Phase 1 sets shape; per-axis scorers in Phase 2–N | Each axis gets its own scorer plan as part of class plans |
| M6. Lineage propagates and recurses | Phase 4 of ToK series (TC6) extended cross-class | Builds on `LineageShare` from TC6 |
| M7. Audit bounty pool | Phase 1 (`useful_work_audit_bounty_pool` module account) | Mirror of `probe_bounty_pool` |

**Existing modules that migrate to register as work classes** (Phase 2+, one plan each):
- `x/knowledge` — claim verification, methodology contribution
- `x/counterexamples` — commitment-15 work class
- `x/inquiry` — commitments-16, -18 work classes
- `x/training_provenance` — manifest curation work class
- `x/dialectic` — commitment-17 work class
- `x/toolbox` — tool authoring work class

**New work classes** (Phase N, one plan each, requiring class-registration via M3):
- Training-run attestation
- Eval-suite execution
- Dataset curation
- Alignment artifacts (red-team prompts, refusal training, debate transcripts)
- RL trace contribution
- Synthetic data generation
- Compute kernel / inference optimization

Order is governance-determinable; the doctrine doesn't pin sequencing.

---

## 7. What this is not

- **Not aspiration.** Once Phase 1 binds, every claim of useful-work reward must derive from the formula and prove its substrate-link. A failing invariant test is a broken commitment.
- **Not a marketplace overlay.** Useful work is not a configurable feature. It is the chain's metabolic identity. Disabling protocol reward for non-recursive work is doctrinal, not parameter.
- **Not anti-extraction.** Outward utility is welcome and price-able through `x/billing`. Trainers paying for ToK bundles still flow value to the chain. The doctrine commits only that **protocol-issued ZRN follows the inward loop**.
- **Not a co-equal commitment with truth-seeking or ToK.** The three doctrines are mutually constitutive. Truth-seeking produces; ToK sells; useful work grows. Reading one without the other two is reading a third of the creed.
- **Not complete.** Phase 1 binds 6 of 7 mechanisms structurally; M5 per-axis scorers and M6 recursion-amplified lineage extend incrementally. **The single commitment UW is fixed and indivisible**; its mechanisms evolve through bound deliverables only. New work classes do not require new commitments — they register under M3.

---

## 8. The discipline

Before merging a change that touches useful-work reward code or class registry:

1. Does this change uphold or contradict UW? (Recursion: does the work or its evaluator compound back into the chain?)
2. Is the corresponding mechanism's invariant test updated to verify the new behaviour still upholds UW?
3. If a new work class emerges, is its registration governance-gated under M3 with a verification protocol, a substrate-link contract, and per-axis scorers?
4. Does the change preserve the formula shape `R = base + L × W × Q`? Coefficient adjustments are routine; shape changes are doctrine amendments.

These four checks are the chain's continued faithfulness to its own metabolic doctrine. **We speak through intentions.** Every commit is a declaration. The declaration must match the code.

— *Inception authored 2026-05-10. Free to evolve through bound mechanisms only. UW is indivisible.*

## Appendix A — Phase 0 implementation checklist (for the eventual implementation plan)

1. Adopt this content as `docs/USEFUL_WORK.md` (drop the "Status" header and Appendix; promote sections 1–8)
2. Compute hash and update `.creed-hash`
3. Register UW in `x/creed` module's commitment registry as a doctrinal commitment alongside the 20 truth-seeking commitments and 6 TC commitments
4. Create skeleton `tests/cross_stack/useful_work_invariants_test.go` with:
   - `TestUW_M1_StakeBackedClaim` (skipped, "Phase 1 binding pending")
   - `TestUW_M2_SubstrateLinkMandate` (skipped)
   - `TestUW_M3_ClassSpecificVerificationSharedLifecycle` (skipped)
   - `TestUW_M4_RewardFormula` (skipped)
   - `TestUW_M5_RecursionWeightProjection` (skipped)
   - `TestUW_M6_LineagePropagatesAndRecurses` (skipped)
   - `TestUW_M7_AuditBountyPool` (skipped)
   - `TestUsefulWork_DoctrineAndContractStayInSync` (active — verifies `docs/USEFUL_WORK.md` content hash matches creed registry pin)
5. Update `README.md` to mention the third doctrine in the trio
6. Extend `Plan 5` of the ToK series (when written) to also enforce USEFUL_WORK five-layer integrity

## Appendix B — Open questions deferred to Phase 1+ design

These are not doctrinal commitments; they are implementation choices for the `x/work` primitive plan to make:

- **Stake denomination scale**: per-class stake floor as parameter or formula?
- **Reward-pool source**: dedicated mint-stream like `probe_bounty_pool`, or split from existing PoT block rewards?
- **Recursion-weight cap discovery**: hard cap or auction-based per-block ceiling?
- **Class-deregistration policy**: when a registered class is found fraudulent, are past attestations clawed back or grandfathered?
- **Cross-class-lineage compute cost**: how to bound the recursive lineage walk to keep block production deterministic?
- **Per-axis scorer architecture**: WASM-based pluggable scorers, or hard-coded into `x/work/scorers/`?

Each of these is a design question for the Phase 1 brainstorm/spec/plan cycle. The doctrine commits the shape; Phase 1 commits the structure; class plans commit the per-class semantics.
