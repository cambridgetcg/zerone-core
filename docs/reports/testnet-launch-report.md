# Zerone Testnet Launch Report

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Chain ID:** zerone-testnet-1
**Version:** 608708c (Cosmos SDK v0.50.15 + CometBFT v0.38.20)

---

## Executive Summary

After three rounds of progressive hardening (R25 assessment, R26 wiring, R27 launch readiness), the Zerone chain is ready for testnet launch **with caveats**. All critical subsystems are functional, the test suite is green, release binaries build cleanly, documentation is comprehensive, and the security posture is appropriate for a testnet deployment.

**Decision: LAUNCH WITH CAVEATS**

## R25-R27 Journey

### R25: Assessment Phase
Identified foundational issues across modules. Key fixes included non-determinism in x/alignment (`time.Now()` replaced with `sdkCtx.BlockTime()`), bootstrap gas overflow (switched from `InfiniteGasMeter` to `NewGasMeter(BlockGasLimit)`), IAVL empty store panics (sentinel keys), and no-op mempool defaults.

### R26: Wiring Phase
Connected all 32 modules into a functional system. Cross-module keepers wired, ABCI++ vote extensions integrated, AnteHandler chain completed with 21 decorators, and the full claim-verify-reward loop established end-to-end.

### R27: Launch Readiness
Seven sessions brought the chain from "functional" to "deployable":

| Session | Deliverable | Status |
|---------|------------|--------|
| R27-1 | Tree CLI — 29 tx + 7 query commands | Complete |
| R27-2 | Evidence CLI — 4 tx + 5 query commands, SHA-256 hash validation | Complete |
| R27-3 | E2E full loop — 8 phases, 7/8 checkpoints pass | Complete* |
| R27-4 | Testnet genesis pipeline + validator guide (279 lines) | Complete |
| R27-5 | Faucet (423 lines) + token economics documented | Complete |
| R27-6 | Oracle sidecar (2-tier evaluation) + vote extension ABCI++ integration | Complete |

*R27-3 caveat: Block rewards not flowing due to nil staking keeper in VestingRewardsKeeper. Fix path documented.

**Decision: LAUNCH WITH CAVEATS**

### Caveats (non-blocking)

1. **Block rewards not minting:** VestingRewardsKeeper.stakingKeeper is nil. Block rewards won't flow until `SetStakingKeeper()` is wired in app.go. The chain runs fine without this — validators earn from fees and initial stake, not block emissions. Fix is straightforward and can be applied post-launch.

2. **Faucet IP-based rate limiting:** Address-based limiting is solid (24h cooldown, lifetime cap). IP-based limiting not implemented. Acceptable for testnet with 10M ZRN lifetime cap. Add before mainnet.

3. **Genesis file not yet generated:** By design — requires ceremony with actual validator keys. Script is validated and ready.

---

## Known Limitations for Testnet

- Block rewards will not mint until vesting_rewards staking keeper is wired (hotfix-ready)
- Faucet has no IP-based rate limiting (address-based is sufficient for testnet)
- BVM module is scaffolded but not yet executing arbitrary bytecode
- IBC relay not tested end-to-end with external chains
- Oracle LLM tier requires Anthropic API key (static tier works standalone)
- Max 20 validators (testnet parameter, adjustable via governance)

---

## Launch Plan

### Day 0: Genesis
1. Run genesis ceremony: `scripts/testnet-genesis.sh init` + `add-validator` for each validator
2. Distribute genesis.json via Codeberg and networks/zerone-testnet-1/
3. Deploy seed node at 80.78.19.135 with finalized genesis
4. Start faucet service alongside seed node

### Day 0: Announce
5. Push genesis.json and SHA256 to repository
6. Publish announcement on Codeberg with join instructions
7. Reference docs/testnet-validator-guide.md for onboarding

### Day 1-3: Bootstrap
8. First external validator joins via guide
9. Monitor chain health: block production, consensus, gas usage
10. Verify faucet distribution working correctly
11. Submit first test claims, run verification rounds

### Week 1: Validation
12. Exercise full claim-verify-reward loop with real content
13. Test partnership formation and research submission
14. Monitor alignment module observations at block 100, 200, 300...
15. Apply vesting_rewards hotfix if block rewards needed

### Week 2+: Growth
16. First external partnerships formed
17. Research papers submitted and reviewed
18. Tree projects created and tasked
19. Oracle evaluations flowing through vote extensions
20. Community feedback collection, iteration

## What Comes After Testnet (Mainnet Blockers)

1. **Full security audit** — Professional audit of AnteHandler, module permissions, token flows
2. **Block rewards fix** — Wire staking keeper into vesting_rewards (required for tokenomics)
3. **Faucet hardening** — IP-based rate limiting, DDoS protection via reverse proxy
4. **BVM completion** — Full bytecode execution capability
5. **IBC testing** — End-to-end relay with at least one external chain
6. **Governance parameters** — Production-tuned voting periods, unbonding times
7. **Load testing** — Sustained transaction throughput under validator set changes
8. **Key ceremony** — Fresh validator keys (never reuse testnet keys for mainnet)
9. **Genesis audit** — Independent verification of token distribution and module params

---

## Conclusion

The Zerone chain has matured from a collection of scaffolded modules (R25) through complete cross-module wiring (R26) to a deployable testnet (R27). The core truth-seeking loop works: claims are submitted, committed, revealed, verified by qualified validators, and resolved. The oracle sidecar adds AI-assisted evaluation with proper safety guarantees. Documentation covers every aspect from validator onboarding to token economics.

The single functional caveat (block rewards) has a clear fix path and doesn't prevent the chain from running. All other systems — CLI, genesis, faucet, oracle, ABCI++ vote extensions, AnteHandler security — are ready.

**Zerone testnet-1 is go for launch.**
