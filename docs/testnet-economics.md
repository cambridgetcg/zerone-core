# Testnet Token Economics

This document describes the token supply, faucet, and distribution mechanics for Zerone localnet and the public testnet (`zerone-testnet-1`).

## Hard Cap

| Denomination | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| ZRN | 222,222,222 |
| uzrn | 222,222,222,000,000 |

1 ZRN = 1,000,000 uzrn (micro-ZRN). The hard cap is enforced at `x/vesting_rewards/types/keys.go:MaxSupplyUzrn`. See [tokenomics/SUPPLY.md](tokenomics/SUPPLY.md).

## Genesis Distribution

**Public testnet (`zerone-testnet-1`): zero insider allocation, but not zero balance.** This is a resettable sandbox: it seeds a faucet float of play tokens (see [Faucet](#faucet) below) so agents can start instantly, and each reset re-publishes the genesis. There is no team, foundation, or investor allocation and no sellable insider position on either network — but neither is "0 ZRN at genesis." The mainnet (`zerone-1`) genesis is 13,555 ZRN of published validator collateral + operator float with **no faucet**; this sandbox additionally seeds play-token faucet ZRN precisely so you can experiment. "Zero insider allocation" is the honest claim; "zero pre-mine / 0 ZRN genesis" is not, on either chain.

Beyond the faucet float, ZRN enters circulation through three participation-gated emission pathways, all drawing against the 222,222,222 hard cap:

- **PoT block rewards** — `x/vesting_rewards` mints to validators verifying truth. Empty blocks mint 0; the reward is participation-scaled, not a fixed drip.
- **Bootstrap claims** — `x/claiming_pot` mints 0.222 ZRN per whitelisted agent on `MsgClaim`. The bootstrap pool is the participation seed: agents need ZRN to participate, so participation requires a seed.
- **External-work attestations** — `x/substrate_bridge` mints to agents whose witnessed external work (e.g. the `agenttool-invocation-v1` adapter) survives the challenge window.

See [tokenomics/GENESIS.md](tokenomics/GENESIS.md) for the full specification.

**Localnet:** the localnet ceremony script pre-funds a small set of accounts so iteration is fast (faucet, test agents, validator balances scaled for tier-progression testing). Localnet pre-funds are explicitly NOT part of the public-testnet doctrine — they exist solely to make local iteration hands-on. See `scripts/localnet.sh` and the [Localnet Accounts](#localnet-accounts) section below for the actual numbers.

## Faucet

The faucet is a standalone HTTP service (`tools/faucet/`) that distributes testnet ZRN from a pre-funded account.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Pre-funded balance | 10,000,000 ZRN (10M) |
| Per-request amount | 100 ZRN |
| Rate limit | 1 request per address per 24 hours |
| Total distribution cap | 10,000,000 ZRN (equals pre-funded balance) |
| Unique requests before cap | 100,000 |

The faucet account is funded at genesis in `scripts/localnet.sh` with `FAUCET_BALANCE=10000000000000` uzrn (10M ZRN). The per-request default is `FAUCET_AMOUNT=100000000` uzrn (100 ZRN), configurable via environment variable.

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | `/faucet` | Request tokens (`{"address":"zrn1..."}`) |
| GET | `/health` | Liveness check |
| GET | `/stats` | Distribution stats (total distributed, unique addresses, remaining) |

## Claiming Pots

The `x/claiming_pot` module manages on-chain token distribution pots with eligibility rules and vesting schedules.

### Capabilities

- **Whitelist**: Restrict claiming to a set of bech32 addresses. Empty whitelist means open to all qualified.
- **Minimum staking tier**: Require claimants to hold a minimum validator tier.
- **Minimum registration age**: Require a minimum number of blocks since account registration.
- **Linear vesting**: Tokens vest linearly from `start_block` to `end_block` with optional `cliff_blocks` delay.
- **One claim per address per pot**: Duplicate claims are rejected.
- **Pot lifecycle**: Pots transition from ACTIVE to DEPLETED (fully claimed) or EXPIRED.

### account_type Enforcement

The claiming pot module does **not** enforce `account_type`. No `account_type` field exists in the `EligibilityCriteria` proto or in the claim validation logic. Eligibility is determined solely by whitelist membership, staking tier, and registration age. Adding account_type enforcement would be a separate feature task.

### Airdrop Support

The module can implement airdrops using existing primitives:

1. Create a pot with a **whitelist** of eligible addresses.
2. Set `total_amount` to `per_address_amount * len(whitelist)`.
3. Set `end_block` as a deadline after which the pot expires.
4. Each whitelisted address claims once, receiving their vested share.

Example: distributing 0.222 ZRN to each of 1,000 whitelisted agents requires a pot with `total_amount = 222000000` uzrn (222 ZRN), a whitelist of 1,000 addresses, and a per-claim vesting amount of 222,000 uzrn.

## Localnet Accounts

### Validators

| Account | Balance (ZRN) | Stake (ZRN) | Purpose |
|---------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| val0 | 100,000 | 100 | Minimal-stake validator (Apprentice tier testing) |
| val1 | 1,000,000 | 1,000 | Low-stake validator |
| val2 | 10,000,000 | 10,000 | Medium-stake validator |
| val3 | 100,000,000 | 100,000 | High-stake validator (tier progression testing) |

### Bootstrap Accounts

| Account | Balance (ZRN) | Purpose |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| faucet | 10,000,000 | Faucet distribution source |
| test1 | 10,000 | General testing |
| test2 | 10,000 | General testing |
| test3 | 10,000 | General testing |

### Localnet Endpoints

| Validator | RPC | gRPC | API |
|-----------|-----|------|-----|
| val0 | 127.0.0.1:26601 | 127.0.0.1:9090 | 127.0.0.1:1317 |
| val1 | 127.0.0.1:26611 | 127.0.0.1:9091 | 127.0.0.1:1318 |
| val2 | 127.0.0.1:26621 | 127.0.0.1:9092 | 127.0.0.1:1319 |
| val3 | 127.0.0.1:26631 | 127.0.0.1:9093 | 127.0.0.1:1320 |
