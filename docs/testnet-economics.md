# Local Development Token Economics

This document describes the disposable balances, faucet, and distribution
fixtures used by the Zerone localnet tooling. It is not a public-network
configuration.

`zerone-testnet-1` is a live legacy playground, but its running state predates
this consolidation and these fixture values are not a snapshot of its current
economics. See the
[network status](../networks/zerone-testnet-1/README.md) before interpreting an
older testnet report or guide as current release or joining authority.

## Hard Cap

| Denomination | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| ZRN | 222,222,222 |
| uzrn | 222,222,222,000,000 |

1 ZRN = 1,000,000 uzrn (micro-ZRN). The hard cap is enforced at `x/vesting_rewards/types/keys.go:MaxSupplyUzrn`. See [tokenomics/SUPPLY.md](tokenomics/SUPPLY.md).

## Genesis Distribution

**Live mainnet (`zerone-1`):** genesis contains 13,555 ZRN of published
validator collateral and operator float, with no faucet. There is no team,
foundation, or investor allocation. See [Genesis](tokenomics/GENESIS.md) for
the canonical accounting.

On a protocol network, every wired native issuance caller shares the
222,222,222 ZRN `MintWithCap` gate. H1 `consolidation-safety-v1` preserves
vesting_rewards V1; H2 `founder-renunciation-v1` alone advances it to V2 and
retires the automatic transaction-presence block mint, so an ordinary user
transaction is no longer an
issuance trigger. Remaining source-capable paths include claiming-pot claims
and substrate-bridge rewards. Claiming pots include both the 0.222 ZRN
bootstrap seed and a legacy governance-created general-pot surface under one
lifetime budget. The knowledge probe-bounty rate and `x/tokens` emission
periods remain governance-activatable but are disabled in default/published
params. See the [economic-neutrality rule](tokenomics/ECONOMIC-NEUTRALITY.md)
for the ordered H1/H2 boundary between compensation and issuance.

See [tokenomics/GENESIS.md](tokenomics/GENESIS.md) for the full specification.

**Localnet:** the localnet ceremony script pre-funds a small set of accounts so
iteration is fast: a faucet, test agents, and validator balances scaled for
tier-progression testing. These balances are development fixtures only. They
are not an allocation proposal or a preview of any future testnet genesis. See
`scripts/localnet.sh` and [Localnet Accounts](#localnet-accounts) for the
current fixture values.

## Faucet

The faucet is a standalone HTTP service (`tools/faucet/`) that distributes
localnet ZRN from a pre-funded development account. No public faucet endpoint is
authorised or advertised.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Pre-funded balance | 10,000,000 ZRN (10M) |
| Per-request amount | 100 ZRN |
| Rate limit | 1 request per address per 24 hours |
| Total distribution cap | 10,000,000 ZRN (equals pre-funded balance) |
| Unique requests before cap | 100,000 |

The faucet account is funded at genesis in `scripts/localnet.sh` with `FAUCET_BALANCE=10000000000000` uzrn (10M ZRN). The per-request default is `FAUCET_AMOUNT=100000000` uzrn (100 ZRN), configurable via environment variable.

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | `/faucet` | Request tokens (`{"address":"zrn1..."}`) |
| GET | `/health` | Liveness check |
| GET | `/stats` | Distribution stats (total distributed, unique addresses, remaining) |

## Claiming Pots

The `x/claiming_pot` module manages on-chain token distribution pots with eligibility rules and vesting schedules.

### Capabilities

- **Whitelist**: Restrict claiming to a set of bech32 addresses. Empty whitelist means open to all qualified.
- **Minimum staking tier**: Require claimants to hold a minimum validator tier.
- **Minimum registration age**: Require a minimum number of blocks since account registration.
- **Linear vesting**: Tokens vest linearly from `start_block` to `end_block` with optional `cliff_blocks` delay.
- **One claim per address per pot**: Duplicate claims are rejected.
- **Pot lifecycle**: Pots transition from ACTIVE to DEPLETED (fully claimed) or EXPIRED.

### account_type Enforcement

The claiming pot module does **not** enforce `account_type`. No `account_type` field exists in the `EligibilityCriteria` proto or in the claim validation logic. Eligibility is determined solely by whitelist membership, staking tier, and registration age. Adding account_type enforcement would be a separate feature task.

### Airdrop Support

The module can implement airdrops using existing primitives:

1. Create a pot with a **whitelist** of eligible addresses.
2. Set `total_amount` to `per_address_amount * len(whitelist)`.
3. Set `end_block` as a deadline after which the pot expires.
4. Each whitelisted address claims once, receiving their vested share.

Example: distributing 0.222 ZRN to each of 1,000 whitelisted agents requires a pot with `total_amount = 222000000` uzrn (222 ZRN), a whitelist of 1,000 addresses, and a per-claim vesting amount of 222,000 uzrn.

## Localnet Accounts

### Validators

| Account | Balance (ZRN) | Stake (ZRN) | Purpose |
|---------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| val0 | 100,000 | 100 | Minimal-stake validator (Apprentice tier testing) |
| val1 | 1,000,000 | 1,000 | Low-stake validator |
| val2 | 10,000,000 | 10,000 | Medium-stake validator |
| val3 | 100,000,000 | 100,000 | High-stake validator (tier progression testing) |

### Bootstrap Accounts

| Account | Balance (ZRN) | Purpose |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| faucet | 10,000,000 | Faucet distribution source |
| test1 | 10,000 | General testing |
| test2 | 10,000 | General testing |
| test3 | 10,000 | General testing |

### Localnet Endpoints
